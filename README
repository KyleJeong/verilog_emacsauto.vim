Two emacs verilog-mode functions are mapped.
\a expands all the verilog-mode autos (similar to C-c C-a in emacs).
\d collapses all the verilog-mode autos (similar to C-c C-d in emacs).

Previously if I wanted to update verilog-mode autos, I would
   save and quit vim
   fire up emacs
   do the auto commands
   save and close emacs
   fire up vim.
And in doing so, I would lose all the edit history in vim.
With this I can just type \a and keep all the previous edit history for undos.

This is my first attempt at writing a vim plugin. Code should be simple enough for an average Verilog user to take and fix/enhance according to needs. Doing :he plugin, :he write-plugin, or :he plugin-details should reveal how simple this really is.
